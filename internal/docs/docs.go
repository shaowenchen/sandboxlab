// Package docs renders this repository's own documentation into the static site
// published beside the Helm chart.
//
// The site exists because the chart repository's root would otherwise be a bare
// directory listing — index.yaml and a .tgz — and someone who arrives there from
// `helm repo add` has nowhere to read what they are installing.
//
// It publishes one page: the chart's README, as the site's root. That reader
// came to install something, so installing, upgrading, uninstalling and the
// values reference are the whole of what they need; the repository's own README
// describes building SandboxLab itself and stays where its audience is.
//
// The page is generated from the markdown already in the repository rather than
// written again for the site, for the reason that decides most of this codebase:
// a second copy of a document is a copy that goes stale. The chart's README is
// the one people actually maintain, so it is the one published, and the
// generator is what has to adapt.
//
// Three consequences shape the design:
//
//   - A relative link in the source markdown points at a file — ../../LICENSE,
//     values.yaml — which is meaningless on the site. Links are therefore
//     rewritten to a resolved target: another generated page, GitHub, or the
//     repository's own raw file.
//   - A link that resolves to nothing is a dead end someone was meant to walk
//     through, so it fails the build rather than rendering as a link to a 404.
//   - The markdown uses backtick fences and pipes that the templates also use,
//     so nothing is ever interpolated into a page as raw text without being
//     escaped first.
//
// Stale output is pruned from a manifest rather than by wiping the destination,
// because the destination is also the chart repository: gh-pages holds
// index.yaml and the packaged charts, which a docs build has no business
// deleting. That pruning is also how a page this site stops publishing is
// removed — the last build's manifest names it and this one does not produce it.
